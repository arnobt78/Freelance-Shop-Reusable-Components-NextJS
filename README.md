cd snuzz
npm install
```

### Running Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

---

## Scripts & Usage

- `npm run dev` â€“ Start the development server
- `npm run build` â€“ Build for production
- `npm run start` â€“ Start the production server

## Core Components

### ProductCard

Reusable product card for listing and detail views.

```tsx
import { SingleProductCard } from "@/components/ProductCard/SingleProductCard";

<SingleProductCard
  productSlug="klint-arctic-mint-1"
  productImage="/product-image.png"
  productName="Klint Arctic Mint"
  salePrice="â‚¬ 9,60"
  originalPrice="â‚¬ 14,99"
  saleLabel="Sale 30%"
  shippingLabel="Free shipping"
  stockStatus="in_stock"
  addToCart={() => ...}
/>
```

### CartSidebar

Accessible from anywhere, shows cart items, allows quantity updates, and links to product detail.

```tsx
import CartSidebar from "@/components/cart-sidebar";
// Used in layout, toggled via context
```

### CartContext

Global state for cart items and sidebar open/close.

```tsx
import { useCart } from "@/context/CartContext";
const { cartItems, setCartItems, cartOpen, setCartOpen } = useCart();
```

---

## Context & State Management

- **CartContext**: Provides cart state and actions via React Context.
- **Persistence**: Cart is saved to localStorage and restored on reload.

---

## Routing & Navigation

- **Dynamic Product Detail**: `/product-detail/[slug]` (uses Next.js dynamic routes)
- **Cart Page**: `/cart`
- **Product Listing**: `/products`
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Cart sidebar uses Next.js router for navigation.

---

## Styling & Theming

- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling, custom theme in tailwind.config.ts
- **shadcn/ui & Radix UI**: Accessible, composable UI primitives
- **Custom CSS**: For global styles and overrides

---

## API & Data

- **Static Data**: Products are defined in products.ts as TypeScript objects.
- **Type Safety**: All product and cart data is strongly typed.

---

## Extending & Reusing Components

- All components are modular and reusable.
- To use a component in another project, copy the component and its dependencies, and update imports as needed.
- Example: To reuse the CartSidebar, import it and wrap your app in `CartProvider`.

---

## Deployment

- **Vercel**: Recommended for Next.js.
- **Lockfile**: Use only one lockfile (package-lock.json for npm or `pnpm-lock.yaml` for pnpm).
- **Production Build**: `npm run build` then `npm run start`
